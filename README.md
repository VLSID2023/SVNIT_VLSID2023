# SVNIT_VLSID2023
The repository contains the programs to accelerate Lane Detection Algorithm on FPGA and Processor, especially programmed fot PolarFire RISC-V base FPGA SoC. It uses Sobel Edge Detection from OpenCV. The project is made to present at VLSI Conference happening from 8th January to 12th January.
